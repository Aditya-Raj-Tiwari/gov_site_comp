# This is my first ever group project and I am so happy to have learned to make it possible

> The whole project was done in about a month and i had no idea about django, but i learned it and made it possible in a month :grin:

### Thing I made:
* This is a complete CMS system where we can change the contents from Django admin pannel
* I made the whole design using bootstrap and some not so good styling
* And other simple photo and blogging features
